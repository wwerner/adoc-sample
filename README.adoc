# Asciidoc Sample Repository

Sample Repository for asciidoc-based documentation. Mostly for me personally so I don't forget how to set it up.

Shows how to use includes, figures, theming and build on GH actions in a sane manner.

PlantUML is not yet supported, but will be as soon as I need it somewhere.

## Sample
